This is the final project in class EE628. 

Group member: Mengjie Min, Xinru Zhang and Peihong Yu. 

Our project aims to solve the Qura Insincere Questions Classification problem on Kaggle. Here's the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/overview.

This is a simple test classification problem. The methods we want to try is like this:

First, we clean the data and implement word2vec on dataset.
Second, we try three deep neural networks which are TextCNN, RNN, LSTM individually to get results.
Third, with three results we may get, implement emmbeding on the results to get a higher score.
